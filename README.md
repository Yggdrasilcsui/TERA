TERA-QV
Temporal Equilibrium & Residual Analysis
Qualitative / Vector Form
Overview
TERA-QV is a deterministic framework for reasoning about stability in complex systems over time.
It is designed to analyze systems with:
finite capacity
delayed feedback
residual accumulation
non-linear regime shifts
TERA-QV is not a predictive model, not an optimizer, and not a policy instrument.
It provides a structural audit layer that supports coherent reasoning across time — without reliance on fixed numerical parameters.
Core Question
TERA-QV does not ask:
“What does the system produce?”
It asks:
“Can the system still close its own loops over time?”
What TERA-QV Does
TERA-QV enables:
deterministic structural reasoning
double-entry stability bookkeeping
qualitative decision gates
traceable logic for complex feedback systems
It evaluates returnability, not performance.
TERA-QV does not control systems.
It audits structural plausibility.
Fundamental Concepts
System
A bounded domain characterized by:
inputs and outputs
internal storage
feedback mechanisms
temporal inertia
Residual
An effect that:
is generated by system activity
is not fully reintegrated
accumulates internally or is displaced externally
Residuals reduce stability deterministically over time, even if temporarily hidden.
Return Flow (Closure)
Mechanisms that reintegrate:
energy
material
information
into stable internal cycles.
Loss of return flow implies irreversible loss of stability, regardless of short-term success.
Structural Relation (Informal)
TERA-QV uses structural balance relations rather than fixed parameters.
Informally:
Code kopieren

(Return Flow + Storage + Delay)
≥
(Residual Accumulation + Acceleration)
When this relation reverses, a regime shift occurs.
This relation supports double-entry reasoning:
gains require closure
delays require capacity
acceleration requires damping
Time as an Active Variable
Time is treated as a system component, not a neutral index.
delay masks instability
storage defers consequences
acceleration amplifies amplitudes
repetition replaces randomness
This makes early structural auditing more relevant than late numerical prediction.
Deterministic Decision Gates
TERA-QV applies qualitative but deterministic gates:
ACCEPT
return flows present
residuals bounded
stability structurally plausible
DEFER
insufficient information
missing observation channels
unresolved structural state
REJECT
loss of return flow
uncompensated externalization
apparent but false stability
These gates describe system states, not moral judgments.
Artifacts vs. System Components
Artifact: unintended or secondary effect
Subsystem: persistent, coupled, system-relevant structure
Classification rule:
rare → noise
repeated → artifact
persistent + relevant → system component
Ignored artifacts tend to integrate into the system.
Thermodynamics, Information & Balance (Appendix)
TERA-QV treats energy and information analogously:
both flow
both accumulate
both require return paths
Loss of buffering capacity (e.g. ecological, structural, informational) does not create new energy —
it reduces damping, increasing effective system sensitivity.
This applies across physical, ecological, technical and informational domains.
What TERA-QV Is Not
❌ not a climate model
❌ not an optimizer
❌ not a policy engine
❌ not a moral framework
❌ not a replacement for domain-specific models
TERA-QV evaluates structural plausibility, not outcomes.
Typical Applications
stability audits of long-term strategies
evaluation of transition pathways
detection of hidden regime shifts
reasoning under uncertainty
sanity checks for system narratives
Why No Fixed Numbers?
Because numbers are often:
context-dependent
time-unstable
politically or economically weaponized
TERA-QV asks before quantification:
Is the system structurally closable?
Are delays acknowledged?
Are residuals bounded?
Practical Principle
Not everything that works is stable.
Not everything that appears stable is returnable.
License & Use
Open conceptual framework.
No monetization.
Deterministic logic, transparent reasoning.
Use at own responsibility.
No guarantee of comfort.
Closing Remark
TERA-QV is intentionally precise rather than reassuring.
It provides structure, traceability, and clarity — not hope.
What follows from its use remains a human decision.
