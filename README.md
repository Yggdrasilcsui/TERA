TERA-QV
Temporal Equilibrium & Residual Analysis – Qualitative / Vector Form
Abstract
TERA-QV is a deterministic analytical framework for reasoning about stability in complex systems with finite capacity, delayed feedback, residual accumulation, and non-linear regime shifts.
It is not a predictive model, not an optimizer, and not a policy instrument.
TERA-QV provides a deterministic audit layer that enables precise structural assessment and consistent double-entry reasoning across time, without reliance on fixed parameters.
The framework is designed for use by humans and deterministic computational agents (including AI systems), enabling reproducible reasoning, traceable decisions, and simplified handling of complex feedback structures.
Short Summary
TERA-QV evaluates whether a system remains structurally returnable under stress, acceleration, and uncertainty.
Instead of asking what a system produces, it asks:
Can the system still close its own loops over time?
TERA-QV introduces a deterministic logic layer that supports:
high precision reasoning
double-entry stability bookkeeping
qualitative decision gates (ACCEPT / DEFER / REJECT)
simplified operational handling for complex systems
TERA does not control systems.
It audits structural plausibility.

1. Motivation
Many real-world systems fail not due to missing data, but due to structural blind spots:
temporal decoupling of cause and effect
systematic externalization of residuals
overreliance on linear control assumptions
accumulation masked by delay and storage
TERA-QV addresses these issues by enforcing deterministic structural consistency rather than numerical optimization.

2. Core Concept
TERA-QV evaluates systems through time, not through instantaneous states.
The central question is not:
“What is the current value?”
but:
“Does the system still retain the capacity to absorb, store, and return disturbances coherently over time?”


3. Fundamental Definitions

3.1 System
A bounded domain characterized by:
inputs
outputs
internal storage
feedback mechanisms
temporal inertia

3.2 Residual
An effect that:
is generated by system activity
is not fully reintegrated
accumulates internally or is displaced externally
Residuals reduce stability deterministically over time, even if temporarily hidden.

3.3 Return Flow (Closure)
Mechanisms that reintegrate:
energy
material
information
into stable internal cycles.
Loss of return flow implies irreversible loss of stability, regardless of short-term performance.

4. Core Relation (Structural, Informal)
TERA-QV does not rely on fixed parameters.
It uses structural balance relations.
Informally:
Code kopieren

(Return Flow + Storage + Delay)
≥
(Residual Accumulation + Acceleration)
When this relation reverses, a regime shift occurs.
This relation supports double-entry reasoning:
gains must be matched by closures
delays must be matched by capacity
acceleration must be matched by damping

5. Time as an Active Variable
Time is treated as a system component, not a neutral index:
delays mask instability
storage defers consequences
acceleration amplifies amplitudes
repetition replaces randomness
This makes early structural auditing more relevant than late numerical prediction.

6. Deterministic Decision Gates
(ACCEPT / DEFER / REJECT)
TERA-QV applies qualitative but deterministic gates:
ACCEPT
return flows present
residuals bounded
stability structurally plausible
DEFER
insufficient information
missing measurement channels
structural state unresolved
REJECT
loss of return flow
uncompensated externalization
apparent but false stability
These gates are state indicators, not moral judgments.

7. Artifacts vs. System Components
Key distinction:
Artifact: unintended, secondary effect
Subsystem: persistent, coupled, and system-relevant structure
Classification rule:
rare → noise
repeated → artifact
persistent + relevant → system component
Ignored artifacts inevitably integrate into the system.

8. Climate-Related Interpretation
(No Double Counting)
TERA-QV distinguishes strictly between:
Primary drivers (e.g. radiative forcing)
Amplifiers (loss of buffering capacity)
Examples of amplifiers:
biodiversity loss
reduced evapotranspiration
albedo shifts
urbanization
technical feedbacks (e.g. cooling demand)
These are not new energy inputs, but losses of damping capacity that increase effective system sensitivity.

9. What TERA-QV Is Not
❌ not a climate model
❌ not an optimizer
❌ not a policy engine
❌ not a moral framework
❌ not a replacement for domain-specific models
TERA-QV audits structural plausibility, not outcomes.

10. Typical Applications
stability audits of long-term strategies
evaluation of transition pathways
detection of hidden regime shifts
assessment under uncertainty
sanity checks for system narratives

11. Why No Fixed Numbers?
Because numbers are often:
context-dependent
time-unstable
politically or economically weaponized
TERA-QV asks before quantification:
Is the system structurally closable?
Are delays acknowledged?
Are residuals bounded?

12. Practical Principle
Not everything that works is stable.
Not everything that appears stable is returnable.

13. License & Use
Open conceptual framework
No monetization
Deterministic logic, transparent reasoning
Use at own responsibility
No guarantee of comfort

14. Closing Remark
TERA-QV is intentionally precise rather than reassuring.
It provides structure, traceability, and deterministic clarity — not hope.
What follows from its use remains a human decision.
