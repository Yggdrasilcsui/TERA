# TERA
TERA is intended as a diagnostic and validation framework, not as a predictive model, policy prescription, or optimization engine.
It does not generate solutions; it evaluates claims under explicit constraints.
TERA operates on the assumption that:
time is a finite budget,
evidence is incomplete by default,
residuals matter more than narratives,
and uncertainty must be carried forward explicitly, not resolved rhetorically.
Core Concepts
Time as Budget
Decisions are evaluated against temporal constraints. Delayed effects, accumulation, and path dependency are treated as first-order concerns.
Minimal Testable Statements (MTS)
Claims must be reducible to statements that can be tested, falsified, deferred, or rejected under known constraints.
Gating Logic
All evaluations resolve to one of three outcomes:
ACCEPT — consistent with evidence and constraints
DEFER — insufficient evidence or unresolved dependencies
REJECT — inconsistent with evidence, constraints, or prior state
Residual Accountability
Unexplained variance, externalized costs, and deferred consequences are tracked explicitly rather than ignored or normalized.
Narrative Resistance
TERA is designed to remain stable under rhetorical pressure, ideological framing, and post-hoc justification.
Methodological Position
TERA does not assume perfect information, optimal agents, or equilibrium conditions.
It is compatible with:
system dynamics,
phase-space reasoning,
feedback-dominated systems,
and non-linear response regimes.
TERA explicitly distinguishes between:
measurement and interpretation,
correlation and causation,
local optimization and global stability.
AI Usage
AI assistance, where used, functions strictly as a consistency and coherence layer.
It is not treated as a source of truth, authority, or semantic grounding.
No claim evaluated by TERA is considered valid solely because it is generated, summarized, or endorsed by an AI system.
Limitations
TERA does not:
predict future states,
replace domain expertise,
resolve ethical or normative questions,
or guarantee correctness.
Its purpose is not certainty, but structured uncertainty.
Intended Use
TERA may be applied to:
scientific hypothesis evaluation,
policy and risk assessment,
system design and review,
audit and post-mortem analysis,
and interdisciplinary reasoning under constraint.
It is explicitly not intended for speculative forecasting, persuasion, or justification of predetermined outcomes.
Status
This framework is released in an exploratory state.
Concepts, terminology, and structure may evolve as further evidence, critique, and use-cases are incorporated.
Stability is prioritized over speed.
