# TERA
TERA (Time-Evidence-Residual-Accountability(Schrödingers Gate))
TERA is a deterministic gating framework for evaluating claims under explicit constraints.
It converts claims into minimal testable statements (MTS), compares measurement vs. model output, and returns a hard decision:
ACCEPT / DEFER / REJECT
TERA is designed to be reproducible, auditable, and resistant to narrative drift.
AI assistance is optional and used only as a consistency layer — not as a truth oracle.
